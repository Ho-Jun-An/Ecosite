                    Sustainability is the development/sourcing of goods,
                    products and services to meet our current needs
                    without compromising the ability of future
                    generations to meet their needs. This takes into
                    consideration that the natural resources around us
                    are finite and important that we use such resources
                    rationally. In addition, sustainability also extends to
                    the workplace; ensuring that companies provide
                    workers with appropriate working conditions, job
                    quality, earnings and work-life balance.
